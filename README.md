Analyzing and Predicting COVID-19 Trends with Python
🔍 Data Science in Action: Visualizing and Forecasting COVID-19 Cases 🌍

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed our world. By analyzing the trends in infection rates, recoveries, and deaths, we can gain valuable insights into the current situation and make informed predictions for the future.

In this post, I'll walk you through how we can analyze COVID-19 data using Python, create interactive visualizations, and predict future trends using Facebook Prophet — all while making the process interactive and informative!

📊 Steps:
Load and Aggregate Data: I used pandas to load COVID-19 data and clean it, aggregating it by date to track the daily number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Visualize the Data: With Plotly, I created interactive graphs to visualize the trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
Forecast the Future: Using Facebook Prophet, I forecasted the number of confirmed cases for the next week based on current trends.

🔮 Key Takeaways:
Data Processing: The power of pandas in cleaning and aggregating COVID-19 data to track the spread over time.
Visualization: Plotly makes it easy to create interactive graphs that can be shared and explored by anyone — perfect for presenting data clearly.
Forecasting with Prophet: Facebook Prophet is a powerful library for time-series forecasting, helping predict future trends even when data might be noisy.
By using these techniques, we can gain insights into how the pandemic is progressing and predict future trends with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

🚀 Let's continue to use data science to tackle global challenges!
